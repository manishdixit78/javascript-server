  **MERN stack**
  
**About Stack:**
      As the mobile and web application development services have stepped onto the next level in the last few years, these applications are built using “Stack” of several technologies these days. A stack is referred to when we speak of a combination of programming languages and software beneath a development project in question. A technology stack is a fundamental element of a mobile or web application.

**what is MERN stack:**
      MERN is considered as a fancy kid in town with full-stack JavaScript. It is a combination of technologies used to build premium web applications. These are developed using multiple technologies including frameworks, databases, libraries and more. MERN stack is a JavaScript stack used for the effortless flow of the development process.
      From the client-side (Front-end development) to the server-side (Back-end development), MERN covers the entire development cycle.
      It also carries an extensive suite of pre-built testing tools.
      React is a library and not a framework and it gives you the tools to build your own application. An architect can design the application with full freedom to choose from the functions of the library.
   The MERN stack is comprised of four powerful web development technologies that, when used together, have far more efficient and effective results. MERN is simply an acronym for these four technologies when used in tandem. They are:
  (1) MongoDB: An open-source, document-based database.
  (2) Express: A minimalist web framework for Node.js known for its speed.
  (3) React: A front end JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.
  (4) Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that operates on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine and brings JavaScript to the server.

**Explore the parts of the MERN stack**

**(1)MongoDB**
     MongoDB is a cross-platform document-based database known as a nonrelational document-orientated database, or NoSQL. Conventional relational databases use a schema design based on tables and columns, however, MongoDB has no such schema. 

**(2)Express**
     Express is a back end framework for Node.js web applications.Express’s framework was designed to enable simple, easy construction of APIs and efficient web applications. It is loaded with plugin features and is renowned for its speed. Its minimalistic structure makes it simple for developers to pick up and start using right away.
    
**(3)React**
     React was created by one of Facebook’s software engineers and later made into an open-source library. It is maintained by Facebook alongside a dedicated group of individual and corporate developers and can be used to create views rendered in HTML. 

**(4)Node.js**
    Node.js is a cross-platform JavaScript Runtime Environment that was originally created for Google Chrome and open-sourced in 2008. Node.js is built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine and is intended to allow developers to build scalable network applications and execute JavaScript code outside of browsers.
