5 fetaures of VS Code:
1. Support for multiple programming languages:
It supports multiple programming languages. So earlier, programmers needed Web-Support: a different editor for different languages, but it has built-in multi-language support. This also means it easily detects, if there’s any fault or cross-language reference, it’ll be able to detect it easily.
2. Extensions and Support:
Usually supports all the programming languages but, if the user/programmer wants to use the programming language which is not supported then, he can download the extension and use it. And performance-wise, the extension doesn’t slow down the editor as it rums as a different process.
3. Git Support:
Resources can be pulled from Git Hub Repo online and vice-versa; saving can be done too. Resource pulling also means to clone the code which is made available on the internet. This code can later be changed and saved.
4. Hierarchy Structure:
The code files are located in files and folders. Along with the required code files, it also has some files, which may be required for other complex projects. These files can be deleted as per convenience.
5. Task Runner:
Last but not least, Visual Studio Code also has a built-in Task Runner, which provides some level of convenience.


Plugins for Visual Studio Code:
1.  Remote – Containers:
Containers have gained popularity in development and if you make use of remote containers, this extension is for you. It provides a full-fledged tool and a well-defined runtime stack to be used for containerizing your programs directly from the VS Code UI.
2. Better Comments:
Good comments often make the difference between maintainable code and a huge mess. This extension does exactly what the name claims – it makes your comments more human-friendly by letting you categorize your annotations into alerts, queries, TODOs, highlights and more.
3. Image Optimizer:
An alternative to TinyPNG is Image Optimizer that also offers support for animate GIF compression in addition to JPEG, PNG file formats.

5. Prettier
Prettier is the most popular code formatter in web dev right now. It allows your team's code look the same, no matter who wrote it. This extension makes it possible to automatically apply Prettier and quickly format whole JS and CSS documents. If you also want to throw ESLint in the mix, there is Prettier - Eslint.
6. Color Info

8. Polacode :
If you tend to look at tutorials and how-tos, you’ve probably come across the perfect code screenshots the authors sometimes include. Odds are these were produced using Polacode – a polaroid for your code.
